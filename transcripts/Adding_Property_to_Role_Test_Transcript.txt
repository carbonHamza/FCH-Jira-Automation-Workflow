So we are replacing society now. So that's all us now. How are we going to change our Is all we Then we're working all of We're working with those.
I was working with a future. It's a Oh, that's not case. How's it going guys? Hello, how are you?
I'm good, how are you?


@2:20 - Yair Strano
Good, good, it's going good, how about you? Okay, sorry, just running back-to-back meetings this morning, so I'm a little bit late.
Let me just get my head in the game here, one second. Okay, how was everyone's weekend?


@3:10 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
It was nice. It was good, yeah. And yours? You guys are muted. Can you hear? Can't hear a thing.


@3:24 - Yair Strano
Hello? Hello. Oh, there you are, there you are.


@3:30 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Adi, was joined here. Yes, you can hear me.


@3:32 - Yair Strano
Is it by now? Yeah, I can, I can hear you.


@3:38 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
What are you guys, what are you guys eating over there on the table?


@3:41 - Yair Strano
Is that like puffed corn? Yeah, yes. Puffed corn. Just treated plastic. Nice, fantastic. And that is what? Popcorn.


@3:53 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Oh, popcorn. Oh, got you.


@3:54 - Yair Strano
Popcorn and puffed corn. Nice. That's good. um i'll also snack away at my my dry breakfast cookie while we eat um so what do we have on the table is everything in pakistan okay yes yes everything is okay wonderful how about delhi i don't everything okay oh yes man okay good good how's the weather doing um no it's cold really cold um we've got a very cold front we got a bit of snow though on the weekend a little bit not too crazy um and um yeah but i feel like this is probably the last like peak february is normally the coldest month and then it starts getting warmer so all good um


@5:03 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So our agenda today would be to discuss the archive facility functionality, and in our last meeting we actually decided that instead of having archive facility as an RBAC permission, we would actually add it as a property of our own.
So starting with the why of this, so we recently have encountered a use case that we have terminated our contract with GoNet, and it is required that we would like to remove that facility from our application, but we decided that deleting that facility would be a very aggressive action, instead we should be able to archive it.
And for that we decided decided to come. So we are going to discuss today and the other reason for keeping it in our system is that if in future there are any audits required, they can be conducted on the data that are related to archived facilities.
All right. So we, the tickets of archiving facility and heading property to a role are lined up and we shall go one by one and discuss them in detail.
And there are some questions from the product side, which we would like everyone to answer. So starting the first ticket that we have for this is implementing backend architecture that is self-explanatory, we can move to the second ticket.
And the second ticket is user should be able to add property to role during add slash edit role. So, Bilal, can zoom in a little bit, zoom out or zoom in, zoom in, all right, so in this ticket, what would be required is that we should give the user the ability or switches inside add or edit a role modal while they are trying to add a role and role type of user of administration, so when the user opens add slash role modal, they should now see the following three toggles along with other options that already exist.
The first toggle would be all active facilities, the second toggle would be all archive facilities, and the third toggle would be hide role.
By default, all the toggles should be switched off, that is, if the user doesn't turn them on, it means they should be saved with zero in the db, not none.
Also, it will be required to assign all roles. Okay, so hang on, pause.


@8:09 - Yair Strano
I already see some problems with this. Let's work from the end. Need to assign all roles, all existing roles are going to get a false flag of zero?


@8:24 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, they need to assign a value.


@8:30 - Yair Strano
Yeah, we can't make a blanket statement and say that every single existing role in the app is going to have zero, meaning they're going to have no visibility of active facilities, no visibility of archive facilities, and the hard role will be nothing.
We can't do that.


@8:48 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
No, yeah, like, it doesn't mean they won't have visibility of active facilities. It is a property of a role.
So let me define what all active facilities and all archive facilities and the hard role is. do do Let's Let's Let's Let's
It's like when you are creating a new role here in the application, what all the switches, all the toggles are turned off by default, like they are a zero.
So if there are existing roles, instead of them being null, we would assign them a zero value, and then you can go into the application, and you can go role by role and give them the property X for it.
That's exactly what I'm saying. That's highly problematic.


@9:28 - Yair Strano
It's too much work for people to do that role by role, right? Wouldn't we, wouldn't we, yeah, this, and this is the challenge to the team, and we need to start thinking like this.
Our application is constantly being used, right? And it's going to be used even more so as we release features like pre-intake.
So here's the question to you guys. What do you think is going to happen in the field if you push a release?
And all these individuals, their values are zero. What happens in the field? Nothing.


@10:06 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
No, they can't access facilities if it's zero. They can't facilities that are assigned to Yeah, actually, Ramza is trying to say that, like, now he will define the functionality of these all active and all agai facilities.
So I think if I am getting what are you saying, Yair, like, that is problematic. But, like, I think Ramza has some other definition of all active facilities and all archived.
So I think we should listen in first. Then I think we should talk about it.


@10:47 - Yair Strano
So let me define what all active facilities mean.


@10:52 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
If any role is given this property, that means it is one for that role. So it's on. Then this property of a role grants any user with a role access to all facilities by default, and they would have access to even all the facilities that will get created in the future.
This is that property. If it's zero, all users will have access to the facilities that are already assigned to them.
Oh.


@11:23 - Yair Strano
Man, this is confusing. So we are still going to be assigning access to facilities through the user management and administration, but this is like an overriding...


@11:41 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Previously, we decided that, like, facilities will be just populated in the user management according to the role. Facilities will be what?
Facilities be populated according to the role when you will create a user in the user management. So let me give you an example here.
What would happen when we make this release? For example, super admin role. All these properties for super admin role would be zero.
Nothing changes. Super admin is already assigned six facilities. But if this property of all active facilities is not switched on for that role, in future, if you're adding another facility, you would have to manually go in and assign a facility.
But instead of doing that, if you go into the super admin role, edit it, and turn on this property, then what would happen is that any future, any facility that gets added into the application gets automatically assigned to you, including the facilities that you already have.


@12:47 - Yair Strano
I understand. I understand. Okay, now I get it. I got very confused here. So let me reiterate to make sure I understand what you said.
I understand. understand. I I I I I Thank Access to facilities for most users, and actually all users, meaning the base level of access to facilities is executed and assigned via the administration user management.
When you add a user, you say what facilities they are to get. And that is for the vast majority of the user base.
In addition, and for that, every time you want to give access to an individual, you have to go in manually and say, give them also access to Clayton, give them access to Doherty.
In addition, we have above the base level access, a higher level kind of umbrella access, which is driven through the role, not the person.
And at the role level, you're saying that there are three properties that can be turned on or off for each role.
And they are, give access to all facilities, even future facilities, or even if you only have one facility at the base level, you now have access to everything.
Or and give access to all archived facilities, past and future. And then there's this hard role, which is simply, it hides the role from the view of the user management.
So whoever has that role, that those people don't appear in the running list of the directory. Did I say that correctly?
Yes, you did.


@14:42 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Okay.


@14:43 - Yair Strano
So, okay, so then there's no issue there. That's 100% right. Okay, one second. Let me just think about this.
Okay. Right, so you're right. You've got to make the changes. It doesn't do anything. Everything that can be zero, that's correct, and then they go in one by one and decide, because most users are not going to get the one, most users are going to be zero.
And then you would go super admin, site leadership, like only the leadership roles, you would give them the one for archived or for all facilities.
Okay, so then here my, so number three, no issue. So here's my other question. How do we link the view, meaning from the base to the umbrella, are we ever showing in the directory whether that person has, like, because you know how we list out all the facilities?
Yes, yeah. It's been handled.


@15:53 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So we actually like already decided all these points that you are thinking. So I'll go over that when we proceed over that.


@16:03 - Yair Strano
Okay, okay, cool. Okay, fine. Then the only other third comment I have is for hard role, they're going to forget that the hard role is going to be on the directory.
Can we be explicit and say hard role from, what do you want to call it, like user directory or from user management?


@16:26 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes, yeah, like we will actually define from which manager. We would like to hire users of that role. It is one of the questions.
Okay, okay, okay. All right, cool.


@16:37 - Yair Strano
Well then, with all that being said, no questions. All right, yeah. Okay. Sorry about that, guys. Keep going. I'd rather over ask than assume.
So thank you for clarifying all that. Yeah.


@16:56 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
That's good. Yeah, I like. So we have like. 10 tickets for implementing these functionalities and all these edge cases.
So we'll go over them one by one. And so now looking at the definitions and re-identiting them over again, this property of like all active facilities, this property of a role grants any user with role access to all facilities, even the facilities that get added into the application anytime in the future.
All active facilities, this property of a role grants any user with the role access to all active facilities and its data, hide role.
This property of a role hides from the view of the other users from the following menus, user management administration, file manager, checklist, assigning drop-down.
So tell me about that last one, what is the checklist to assign drop-down?


@17:57 - Yair Strano
So in the checklist menu and in the


@18:00 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
The facility tab, when you're trying to assign a user as an investigator for safe and issue reports, event types, modality review.
So if you click on the dropdown, the name of devs especially come on the top. Okay, brilliant. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


@18:19 - Yair Strano
Good call out. So then you also need to do it in all the filters of the user. Wouldn't you say, like, instead of going into the detail of every single feature that has a dropdown of the users, because we have a lot of those, right?
Like, we've got a few filters that have the, oh, is the, no, the submitted by is just by the person who would have done it.
So we don't actually search for everyone. Yes, yeah. Right. I see what you're saying. So is that question mark asking, is there anywhere else that we've forgotten?
Yeah.


@18:53 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Is there anyone else that we need to do it? So your call out is also good. Like we can.
see if there are any drop-downs other than this checklist select assign drop-down and we can implement it over there as well then names of the users with the role that have the checkbox selected or toggle switched on or vital their name should not appear correct yeah that makes sense all right so we need to figure out the drop-downs all over there yes it's a shame that we don't and i wonder whether this is kind of part of a refactor exercise sorry excuse me for speaking with my mouth um i wonder whether there's a a refactor exercise that we tag anywhere in the app anywhere that's a filter of a search or drop-down of the user list is a direct input from the user management screen question see question it's


@20:00 - Yair Strano
That we categorize it as the general, general user dropdown versus the user who is action-driven, submitted by, is only if you perform that action.
If we had a list of all the general and we kept a running list of it or if it was called somewhere in the code base, it might be easier.
But anyway, just, I don't even know if that's realistic from a technical standpoint.


@20:28 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Maybe for the specific purpose, like if, when the product will sweep the app, we will also see if there are any menus that should be action-driven and they have not.
So we'll fix that, fix those as well. Okay. Okay, cool. So an important point is the users with the role, with height role should be able to see all users with the same role and be able to edit in the user map.
So like, like if the devs have the height role switched on, all devs can see each other and they would be able to edit their, like, perform user management actions in the user management.
We want this for the debugging kind of things.


@21:19 - Yair Strano
Anyone with the hard role turned on should be able to see everything. Like, there should be no exclusion for that hard role is only for others, not for the people who've been hidden.
That is exactly what the statement means. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just, just clarifying.


@21:44 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Plus, there was this other requirement that super admin should also be able to see. I would oppose it because super admin is a dynamic thing, it's a variable.
variable. I I I think we should control it from the role level not with the fixed role. I agree.


@22:07 - Yair Strano
I would take that superadmin comment away and just make sure that superadmin has one for meaning don't hard. Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa no no no no hang on that doesn't make sense.
What do you mean Bilal because how do you... So like if dev role is hidden we are hidden from you as a DR.


@22:28 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Is that something that will cause issues?


@22:33 - Yair Strano
No no no I don't think that we should hide it from the superadmin um I don't think we should hide it from the superadmin but I do wonder whether we should add a toggle for the superadmin view if that went off I
Hard it and see what everyone else has seen. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If they want to see what everyone else has seen, they can go in and change their creds.
They can remove themselves from SuperAdmin and I can put them back. You don't need to worry about this. You can hard it from SuperAdmin too, because that's a lot of extra work for you, right?
Yeah. it will be more effort.


@23:24 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, Take that comment away.


@23:30 - Yair Strano
You don't need to worry. You don't need to worry about that.


@23:34 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Assign yourself the dev role of Relic to see data related to devs in the user manager. You can have multiple roles.
Oh, that's a great idea, Hamza.


@23:45 - Yair Strano
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically, you make sure that one, you assign yourself dev to see everything and then take dev away to see what everyone else sees.
ACTION ITEM: Update tickets: remove superadmin exception; rename sub-role Access; add Access filter; add Archive tab; archive modal; unarchive; move Facility Units - WATCH
Yeah, that's a great idea. Perfect solution. Okay. So, yeah, that red card. Comment that first asterisk can go away.
Yeah.


@24:05 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So we can move down. So we'll make the modifications after the meeting. No problem. Yeah, we can continue.


@24:14 - Yair Strano
This is great.


@24:16 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
We'll get refreshed. So the important UI change, and this is what you had the question about. So properties assigned to a role should be displayed in the role card in the roles menu.
We would, in future, have a design review meeting where we'll look at the new and improved role card, where we will be able to see if a role is given some property.
So like we would see some flag or an icon that they have this property. For any user with a role with all active facilities property, it should say all active facilities in the user management table under the facility column.
We won't show other, all the names of the facilities, we would show only a single text inside. Appell, all Active Facilities.
Can we hear? Over here. If this role was given all Active Facilities, it would not list on all the facilities, would just say all Active Facilities.
In a poll. Lovely. For any user, for any user with a role with all Active Facilities property, it should say all Active Facilities in the user management table under the facility column.
Like, and if they are given both properties, then they would have two Pills, yeah.


@25:40 - Yair Strano
What? Two Pills. Now, are the two Pills gonna fit, or?


@25:46 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, like it's gonna be all Active Facilities, all Active Facilities, and then plus one, plus one would show all Active Facilities.
Perfect. Perfect. And we are converting these facility of of them to If If need a a 30? Thank So that the main pill and the plus one pill aligns.
Now, is that for the base level as well?


@26:08 - Yair Strano
Are all facilities going to be put in poll format going forward?


@26:12 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes, yes. Wonderful. Great.


@26:14 - Yair Strano
I love it.


@26:21 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So I think we're done with the ticket, right? I have a question. Okay. So yeah, like all the users with the role that have all active facilities or all archive facilities.
So like we would need to improve our printer as well.


@26:36 - Yair Strano
Yeah. Yeah. Great call outs. We do. We would have now.


@26:46 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Should we add options of all active facilities and all archive facilities? And it, like we have an option of a bin and we select that.


@26:56 - Yair Strano
Connect all active, all archived.


@27:02 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
No, as independent options inside this list, like if we are listing down all the facilities inside it, we will also list down the option of all active facilities and all archive facilities.
And if you click all archive facilities and hit apply, then the table would show all the users with the role of that property.
Yes. In this context, the select all will, how the select all will operate? Select all, then select all facilities plus all the users that have access to like all facilities properties.


@27:40 - Yair Strano
Yeah, the select all becomes tricky and almost redundant, right? Because... It is confusing. The select all really what it's doing is it's pulling in all facilities and all archived, right?
The select all is also pulling in users that have only good at assigned to them.


@28:00 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So, but all active facilities as an independent option will not pull that. It will only pull in all the users that have that property.


@28:17 - Yair Strano
So, select all is the default, right? If you reset and took select all away, the default is you show in everyone.
Yes. And then you've got the details of each facility. And then you've got the all facilities and all archived.
I don't think you need to select all anymore.


@28:40 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So, select all also serves the use case of selecting all and then deselecting a few.


@28:47 - Yair Strano
That's true, that's true, that's true. Yep. That's a good argument.


@28:53 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I have an idea, like, can we keep the facility filter as it is and have a separate toggles for...
So all active and all archived facilities, which will disable this filter?


@29:11 - Yair Strano
I mean, it's less confusing and maybe easy to develop. I'm not opposed to that.


@29:24 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Why do we need a separate filter? Why can't we have it like inside the facility itself? But if you've selected that, you can't select any others.
If you select the others, it will deselect that. Like you already do in other places as well, right? Like the mental health pre-intake checkboxes, right?
If you select the bottom two, you can't select the top one. If you select the bottom two, can't deselect it.


@29:52 - Yair Strano
Good idea. Good idea.


@29:57 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
We also have a select or deselect.


@30:01 - Yair Strano
No, the select all will not apply to the two top. So basically, we could do what Haseeb's suggesting. You have two top filters, sorry, two top options that appear above select all.
You've got all facilities, all archived facilities, and then you've got select all. If you select select all, it highlights everything except the top two, right, because the select all is at the detail of every facility.
And maybe what we do with select all is we put a parenthesis and says detail, right, like it's the detailed or specific, select all, specific, ungrouped.
So if you select all, it highlights everything below the top two that are all facilities and all archived. If you hit all facilities, everything else gets disabled, and if you hit all archived, everything else
gets disabled or maybe you said that all facilities and all archive can be hit at the same time but you could have a split within the filter almost like a line where you have two groups and then you've got the detail below it is that what you see or did I mix and match over there I think you said it right can we add a divider in this drop down because if we don't add the divider then it will be confusing yes it can be added what are your views I think you have created this design component honestly we are trying to achieve too many things from a single drop down it's it seems like it's might not seem to be confusing because we are discussing but when we implement that same function


@32:01 - adil khan
It's going to be a little tricky for other people. You mean for the user? Yeah, because in the entire application, select all, select all the options which are available in the dropdown, but we are changing the behavior just for this specific feature.
So we are breaking the convention actually.


@32:23 - Yair Strano
Right, so then, okay, so let's go with Adil's thought. If select all is supposed to select everything? What's the downside of clicking select all and it shows also all archived and all facilities?
What's the downside of that?


@32:42 - adil khan
So the thing is, like, facility dropdown does not tie, actually it's a two different thing. The select all archive facilities tied to the role, not to the facility actually.
So, if you wanted to filter out the user who has... ... ... ... ... ... ... And like as permission to all the active facilities, I think we should have another filter.


@33:06 - Yair Strano
Ah, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what you're saying makes sense because what we can do is put a sub role, it's almost like a sub, subset to the role, right?
Like when you assign a role, there's a subset and what are the subsets? You either have access to all facilities or you have access to all the archived facilities.
So if you have subsets, maybe it should be role, sub role with two dropdowns that are multi-select, all facilities or archived, and then you get facility, right?
Because that's at the base level. And then we stick with the way we are assigned in it also within the permissions, which basically is what Bilal was saying, just not in a radio button, you're saying put it in a dropdown.
Yeah. The first option is we'll meet all facilities.


@33:59 - adil khan
All. The hard role is irrelevant because the hard role doesn't appear.


@34:08 - Yair Strano
So you can't, there's no point in putting it. But yes, you would do it for, I kind of like the tag of sub role, right?
Like it's a subcategory of the role. And in the sub role, there are only two options, which is all facilities or archived.
And then you don't need to get into the whole mess. So you keep facility as it, because it's more on the base level of the users.


@34:34 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, good call out.


@34:36 - Yair Strano
I think Adil's right. Does anyone have any objection to that?


@34:44 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I don't have any objection, but here's an example. Like no role is selected, no sub role is selected, but user comes in and select GoNet.
So we will bring in all the users with the role that have the property of all activities as well, right?
Yeah, that that is. it's correct.


@35:00 - Yair Strano
You are right that there's crossover, meaning if the umbrella access will appear at the base axis, yes, because all facilities is comprised of Gwinnett.
I think that that is right. That is yes. I mean, is there a problem with that?


@35:28 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
No, like, I'm just confirming that would also, like, it would make sense to bring in that user and also, like, we should do it.


@35:37 - adil khan
Yeah.


@35:39 - Yair Strano
Right. Right. Yeah. I agree with you.


@35:46 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So we would draw this, drop down the sub role?


@35:52 - Yair Strano
I would call it sub role because it's a property of the role, right? Like, when we're adding the role now where we put in these,
Like tags, Ross, they're like role tags, or I would say sub-role, yeah, for the lack of a better term.


@36:13 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
All right. Why don't we call it them as access?


@36:16 - adil khan
Because it really gives you the access of active facilities and archive facilities.


@36:27 - Yair Strano
Sorry, please say that again. Role access?


@36:30 - adil khan
think, yeah, we swipe it access, because it's really giving you all the, like, access from all the facilities, all the active facilities, all the archive facilities, granting you all the access of active and archive facilities.
Hmm. Instead of calling a sub-role, because I attribute of a role. I'm not opposed to that.


@36:57 - Yair Strano
Access makes sense. So it'd be role, access, do you want to, uh, yeah, I'm okay with that, coordinate access, I think that's fun.


@37:18 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Great.


@37:19 - Yair Strano
Yeah, we could do that, role, access, I was just wondering whether we should, whether it should be called, no, that's fine, access is good, yeah, it's more explicit, it's more explicit.


@37:35 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I have a question, let's say a role which has all the toggles turned off, like this, all archive facility, all active facility and hide role, and if that role is selected, do we need to still show that access drop down for that case?
No, meaning if,


@38:00 - Yair Strano
You've gone and hidden all the roles that don't have that access, then that drop-down would be disabled, because there's nothing to show.


@38:09 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
What if, since the role is a multi-select field, what if one role has those toggles turned on and one has turned off, then the drop-down will appear, right?
Yes. I think the access drop-down is not exactly dependent on the role drop-down. Like, if they select a role that does not have any of these properties turned on, but they still come in and select one of the properties from the access drop-down, we will just show no data.
I see, kind of like Excel or like Google Sheets.


@38:46 - Yair Strano
Like, that's just a standard filter. Like, you can basically, like we were saying the other day, you can allow the user to get to, like, an eliminated state where there's nothing to see.
Yes. That's fine. That's also cool. That's fine. Like, here's the other thing, right? Very few people are going to have this access, and we know who they are for the most part, but it will be used.
It will, because, like, as leadership gets onboarded or off-boarded, it's a quick way to see whether they've got the right access for all facilities and archived.
So, I wouldn't worry about, if you go hard, like, let's say, leadership, and they're no longer in the view of roles, but then you go say, okay, all archived in all facilities, you'll get nothing.
That's okay, in the search result.


@39:45 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So, should we log the scope, or any other questions from anyone outside? I don't have any questions. Proceed to next.
Thank you. Okay, so the next one is this. So the next ticket is handling user management of a user with a role with all active facilities property.
So the scenario one is adding a user with a role that has all active facilities property. When a user clicks on plus add user CTA, an add user modal should open, and when the user selects a role with all active facilities property, then the facility select drop-down should become disabled as it will not require to select any facilities for that user.
It will not be visible, I think. So initially it would be visible because we haven't selected any role yet.
Yeah, when role will be selected, will be invisible. So removing it from the view is like changing the height of the modal, so that is glitchy.
Would you just disable it? In card assignment we have done this with the, I think, facility. The whole unit is not assigned to that card.
Then we short the modal height. That's not happening at run. In current, we do. No, no. It's not. In V1, it's implemented.
It was in the previous version. Yes. So what is better at a UI level? Could we like, remove it or disable it?
So guys, I think we, we already have a ticket in the sprint where we have mimic permissions.


@41:52 - adil khan
So we already have that thing where the one drop down disappear based on the drop down selection or it will appear.
email for free. So,


@42:12 - Yair Strano
But weren't you concerned that it would be glitchy?


@42:16 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, it would actually still be like they selected a role for which all active facility property is like but they can be selected and then it will appear again.
But like yeah, we do have it in some place. So that wasn't in my mind. If we have already been doing it, we remove the field.
So being consistent, I guess we can like do the same over there as well. Remove the facility field if they are selecting a role with that property.


@42:51 - Yair Strano
Okay, I mean if the team feels strongly that this is practice that we shouldn't be doing in general. the overall.
We That can be challenged. I don't know if we're opening up a can of worms with this. How glitchy is it?
Like, how much of an issue is it?


@43:13 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I see it on the app. Yeah, you can navigate to card assignments. It's not that bad over here.


@43:50 - Yair Strano
Not terrible at all.


@43:54 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Not terrible. What does the team think? We are also increasing the height of modal by selecting like multiple things in select features.
I think in our whole app, heights are adjusted according to the data in the modal. So I think it will not be an issue.
Okay. And also like why we show like something if that is disabled, like there is no point to show them.


@44:28 - Yair Strano
Yeah, I mean, we do it with, we do it only when it's informational, right? Like let's say for the safe report, we do it so they just remember what facility they're in.
There are a few places I think we do it deliberately to show the value. But here, I agree, you know, like there's no point in showing it, right?


@44:53 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
There's a lot of information on the screen and the modal suddenly readjusts, then the user can sometimes get confused as to what happened.
But if there's like less options, then it's fine.


@45:03 - Yair Strano
Yeah, in which, in these cases that we've seen, I agree with you, Zainab, these don't seem to be too drastic, right?
It's just kind of like two or three fields, like now three becomes two. Same thing with adding a user, there aren't that many drop-downs.
So, yeah, I mean, if the consensus of the team is that you guys are okay with it for now, and I think we do, we take, like what Zainab said is very insightful, because it shouldn't be common practice.
Like in a modal where there is a lot going on, it could get confusing, and maybe over there we just disable instead of kind of reshuffle.
But I think for what we have now, add in a user, if I recall, it's about three fields, right?
You select the role. like so. is Select the Facility.


@46:03 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
You enter the user, first name, last name, and then email, and then we have the role field.


@46:09 - Yair Strano
And Facility, right? Then Position, and then Facility.


@46:14 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Oh, we added Position.


@46:16 - Yair Strano
So it's First Name, Last Name, Email, Role, Position, Facility. So the three after the first name will stay and Facility will drop because the position has all access, right?
The role has all access, yeah.


@46:34 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Sorry, the role has all access.


@46:36 - Yair Strano
Yep. I think that makes sense.


@46:44 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I think that makes sense.


@46:45 - Yair Strano
I will call out once again, I'm just going to say it, I think that this modal is too small and that first name and last name are too small of an area for top-in.
But we do have a ticket as well for this.


@47:03 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Okay, wonderful.


@47:04 - Yair Strano
I don't know whether Hamza wants to broaden it, instead of stacking it so much, like however he wants to deal with it, that's fine.
But I think over the last week or two, we've seen a few times that we've opened some modals and the first name, last name is small.
ACTION ITEM: Add bulk-upload validation: no facilities for All Active; error rows to error file - WATCH


@47:24 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Okay, great.


@47:26 - Yair Strano
So let's continue.


@47:31 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
All right. So the second part of this scenario one is like when any user is being added to, through bulk upload and if the user is being given a role with all active facilities property, then facility field should not be a required field.
If the user adds any facility for that user in the bulk upload file, then throw an error and add that row to the error file, then the failed region cannot assign facilities to this role.
So continue. right. let's continue. continue. All right. continue. All right. All So hang on, let me make sure I understand this.


@48:06 - Yair Strano
When a user clicks on Edit C Channel, an Edit User modal should open, and when the user selects a role with all facilities property.


@48:17 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, the paragraph before it. Wait, you're in Scenario 2, right?


@48:25 - Yair Strano
I'm Scenario 1.


@48:27 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Oh, you're still in Scenario 1.


@48:28 - Yair Strano
Oh, so when any user has been added through bulk, oh yeah, so this is basically bulk upload, if they go bulk upload to someone with a role that, by definition, has all facilities, and they put in facilities in the cell of facilities with a comma, you'll kick back an error saying, you cannot assign facilities to this role.
Yes. Completely understood. Okay. So now we're in Scenario 2.


@48:58 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Anything user. Anything user. Finding a role that has all active facilities property. So like, just like add an edit as well, like if, while editing a user, any modification is made to the role drop-down and a role gets selected, which has that property of all active facilities, we will remove the facility drop-down.
So basically, same behavior, just from the edit, is that what you're saying?


@49:28 - Yair Strano
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.


@49:35 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
What will happen here, like, if that role is unassigned, that has all active facilities or all archive facilities, so we should show the facility drop-down.
And also, because technically all the facilities are assigned. Yeah. Yeah.


@49:58 - Yair Strano
Yeah.


@50:00 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So what we will do in that case, we will unassign, we will show the dropdown, but nothing will be selected, right?
That's a good call-out, Mubashir.


@50:12 - Yair Strano
That's a good call-out. How do we handle when the role no longer has the, when you remove the all facilities from the role, that user now has no facilities in its user management.
So number one, we need to show a caution. Number two, we need to throw a notification. Let me think about this.
I mean, , we could go down a path on this. The most efficient thing to do is to show a caution and a notification, right?
Or should it just be a caution to keep it simple? Okay. You


@51:03 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I think just a caution that you have removed the all active facility role, you need to select the specific facilities for this user.
think that's enough. Because that drop down will be empty, facility drop down, we need to select the facilities. Wouldn't it be better if we are removing this property for any role, so we automatically assign all the facilities to that?
No, it's going to be problematic. We cannot assign because that role is removed, right? And facility drop down will appear and they will not be able to save until they select some facilities.
But like even before that, if a role was given this property and then later on, We take that property away from that role, what happens then?
There is also that scenario. We're also going to have to handle the removal of the role in the edit, because if we remove that role from a user, then they also don't have any facilities assigned to them.
That is what Maversha is talking about. We have these two scenarios that we need to No, bulk edit, the bulk edit I meant.
What was you saying? I was saying if a role is given a property of all active facilities, but in future that property is then switched on.
Then there are like 20, for example, users. That's the thing I'm talking about. Exactly that thing. Let's suppose a user was assigned to all active facilities and then later on we decide that he will be just a role where we need to select facilities.
That role will be removed, right? this I'll try your I've I'll and facility drop-down will show up and he will not and someone will not able to save that because no facilities are assigned right on every edit facilities will be checked like it is coming with all facilities or just three or four facilities other facilities will be removed and those three or four will be saved on the left hand side on every edit it will be handled that we need to check the role and facilities that is the case of editing a user yeah but when we are editing a role yeah when we are editing a role then like if there are 30 users assigned to that role we don't know yeah when we are editing a role then we need to revoke the all facilities access to revoke the all should we revoke it like or grant access
Because their role is not changing, that's the property of that role is changing. But they are assigned to that role.
So their role will automatically assign all the facilities to them. we cannot. If we are deciding a behavior for a user while assigning the role, and if we are changing the role, so we should do the same behavior.
What do you say, Adil? Let's hear Adil first.


@54:40 - adil khan
Yeah, my thought is like, let the user have at least one facility as a default facility while adding a user.
So in that case, we don't have to change the existing code base. And if he decided to remove that particular, like remove the all access facility from the role.
I think no. We're still going to be have at least one facility assigned to them. Why do they have to have one facility assigned to them?
In worst case scenario, like if, let's just say a role one has access to all the active facility, and later on, we decided to remove that access.
So all the persons who has role one assigned to them, they at least have one single default facility. But why?


@55:26 - Yair Strano
Why is it important to have one default facility?


@55:30 - adil khan
Because you cannot have, you cannot access the app if you cannot have any facility assigned to. Is that how we have it structured right now?


@55:40 - Yair Strano
Yes, facility is mandatory.


@55:43 - adil khan
You at least have one facility in order to access the app. So mandatory field in the user management.


@55:54 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Understood.


@55:55 - adil khan
Yeah, let them assign at least one facility. that. what if that So Can order? can wanna say have Uh, change anything in the existing, uh, workflow as well.
And if the role has all active facility flagged, yes, then we just simply ignore the facility dropdown in all our backend architecture.
And if we decided to like remove that special power, uh, of that role, like having all the access of the facility, then it's still, have at least one facility assigned to that user.
So it's not going to create panic in case somebody mistakenly remove the permissions.


@56:34 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So I think, we are handling in the app. I think, uh, while user in the facility checklist, we cannot edit them or delete them, right?
Yes. So I, I think if we should not change the role until, unless that role is assigned to someone, was thinking the same, like, yeah.


@57:00 - Yair Strano
Meaning you cannot change the property of a role and remove the all facilities unless you've gone and assigned at least one facility, one additional facility to the person?
Like how would that work?


@57:18 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Unless you have assigned that role from all the assigned users. Yeah. Like that role needs to be delinted. Yeah.
Oh, you've got to delink the role.


@57:32 - Yair Strano
Yeah, from every user. You've got to delink the role.


@57:41 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Then make the modification and then reallocate the role. Got it. Got it. Because within the same epoch we are going to have a bulk edit functionality as well.
I think it will be covered over there, right? If we want to add multiple users to the same role at a time.
there. Okay. Okay. See If we delink the role, will the user have any other role as well? Or can a user be without any role in the app?
Yeah, definitely. will be signed somehow. No, they can't be without a role.


@58:22 - Yair Strano
They have to have at least one other role.


@58:25 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
You cannot, like, let's say if I added this user and remove the role and try to save it, it's a mandatory field.
The user must have one role at least. Yeah. We're trying to remove the toggle of access all facilities. We like then sort of, I don't know, show a list of all the users that will be affected, will be opened without any facility.
And then the person can just select over there if he wants to assign them whatever facility they want. Like that.
You can also toggle it off while assigning facilities to everyone who is going to lose access to you. Yeah, I think Siv has a point, while editing the role, if he tries to revoke the access of all assigned active facilities or required facilities, so we will show him that these users will be affected, what facility you will assign to them.
We can assign them a single facility at a time, if we are editing a role. Yeah.


@59:44 - Yair Strano
What's easier?


@59:47 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I think the user's point of view, like it's easier like what Haseed is saying. Like for the end user it will be convenient.
Yeah, for end user it will will Because in a single click they will assign a single facility and the role will also not be changed so otherwise like they will need to bulk upload the file, will prepare the file and they will be go one by one and unassigned the role so that will be like time taking and we receive a suggestion like in a two or three clicks they will be able to edit the role and assign a facility to users but facility will be a single to all the users.
I think that would be a problem like if we are assigning a single facility to all the users. No, no, like what was like a row of users with like whatever facility you want to assign you can like to my team facilities now.


@1:00:55 - Yair Strano
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah It could get quite long.
We'd have to think about how to handle that. I would say that assigning them a blanket facility is probably acceptable, given that let's walk through the real-life scenario.
You've got a role that you gave access to all the facilities. Yes. You say in midway, after everyone already has that access, hey, I want to take that away from them.
I don't want them to have that. So, what we are suggesting now is instead of, well, forget the instead of, what we're suggesting now is you show a modal saying, these and
Individuals need to be assigned of a facility, at least one, right? You show the list of individuals, and in that list, you've got two options.
You either have to show individual, drop-down, individual, drop-down, individual, drop-down, and they can go, go, go, go, go. Or you show the entire, , you don't even have to show the entire list of individuals.
He'll just say, anyone with this role no longer has a facility, what facility are you assigning to them? And you choose one, and it immediately goes to all those people.
The problem with that is that you don't know who the people are. So if you need to go back and say, no, they've got Gwinnett, I mean, sorry, they've got Tata, and they've got Muskogee, you don't know who that list of people is.
And if you go with what Haseep's suggesting, you say, no, you deliberately choose one by one in the modal, and then you can...
You save it, right? You could save the properties. What happens though, if it's 50 people, you just end up having a paginated modal that you go in like one, two, three, okay, next page, 10, next page, 10, next page, submit.
Is that how it would work? Let's say you got a role though, there are 50 individuals with that role.
Is there an issue with putting that many pages? on the modal?


@1:03:31 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
There's not, like UX-wise, UX-wise, I was saying that.


@1:03:36 - Yair Strano
I mean, look, UX-wise, it's going to be , but it also is not going to be a likely real scenario.
There are very few people who are going to be given access to all facilities. Those people are, excuse me, partners, the executives, and probably a handful or two of leadership individuals.
individual. So speaking at the role level, it's role partner, role executive, maybe role mental health, not manager, director, mental health director, pharmacy director, maybe, so maybe five roles, right?
Which in total is going to be about 20 people. 20 people is not the end of the world to show in a modal if you went to remove that from them, which you never really would remove it from all those roles.
You would never remove it from partner. You'd never remove it from executive. So really, you're talking about mental health director, pharmacy director.
How many people is that? Five to 10 as we scale. You show five to 10 people the way how Seab is suggesting.
You make them select their facility or facilities, plural, save, done.


@1:05:03 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So, Yair, I would like to challenge if it is like a very rare case that will happen like very rarely, then we are also going to have a front-end functionality of bulk-added users.
So if the affected users' names and the user can go into the user management and make the modification over there and then change the role attribute, then it will make more sense.
Because it is a whole new UX that we are going to define for it. I think then we don't even need the names because then the user can just come and filter by role anyway.
Yeah, that's a good point.


@1:05:43 - Yair Strano
The issue is that you're not changing their role, you're just changing the attributes of the role.


@1:05:49 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, so let's say they are changing the attribute of the role and there are user linked to that. But we will just going to show a toast or maybe some error.
But they need to de-link the users that are linked with this role. How you do that? We can have a check on...
no, what do we do?


@1:06:11 - Yair Strano
How do you de-link? You show the toast, and then they go to user management, and what do they do?
Let's say they pull up the one individual. They go into them and they edit. What are they doing?


@1:06:20 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
They will be going to apply the filter of that role, and in this epic, we are also having a functionality of bulk-edited individuals on the front-end level, if you remember.
Yeah, yeah. So they will be going to use that option and select all of those users, and using a one or two-click, they can edit their facility.


@1:06:43 - Yair Strano
But how do you edit the facility if currently their role shows no facility? If they're old, I mean...


@1:06:50 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So that's what I'm saying.


@1:06:51 - Yair Strano
You're not changing the role. You're changing the access. You're not changing the role. That's the problem. Which, by the way, leads back to, so maybe this is the answer.
It's everything you just said, but when you go in there, you're not changing the role. In an edit scenario, so currently what we've said is when you add a user and you give them the role that has all the facilities, you don't show the facility dropdown, right?
You hide it, correct? When you add it, you do show it. Why? Because you can X out of all facilities through the edit.
And you can assign a single facility or multiple facilities. And then if you give them that option, then your suggestion below works.
Why? Because you go to the role, you say, I'm deselecting all facilities. You get a toast. Please make sure to go delink these users, right?
Delink all users with that role. Okay, you go select that role, search, bulk edit, you say, okay, what are you doing with them?
You go to facilities, now you do have a facilities dropdown. X out of all facilities, assign the facilities you want them to get.
Or, go one by one, search for the individuals, edit, you do have facilities now. So we're changing the scope of edit, where above we said edit would not show it, now we're saying edit will need to show it, because it's the only way you can circumvent being unable to change the role access.
ACTION ITEM: Implement role-edit logic: All Active→assign all active; All Archive→block if no active; show toast; keep Facility dropdown - WATCH


@1:08:41 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So yeah, instead of, like, even giving them the toast, what I was saying is that once you switch off that toggle of all active facilities, all users with that role will get assigned, like, all the available facilities that we have.
And then back at it, we can do the orientations. If we do that, if we can do that, then things will be easier.
Can you explain that to me again, Hamzad, just one more time to be sure I'm clear? When the user will switch off the toggle of all active facilities and hit save for that role, all users with that role, we will populate all the facilities.
Instead of having that property of all active facilities, we will assign them all that, all the facilities that are present in the application.
And then through bulk added modifications can be made of removing some facilities for some users.


@1:09:42 - Yair Strano
it, got it.


@1:09:44 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
But this process will take some time, like they will first change the role. No, no, they don't have to change the role.
They were just talking about toggling it off. Toggling it off.


@1:10:01 - Yair Strano
What Hamza is saying is that when you go into the role and you de-toggle, you unselect all facilities and you save, what it immediately does is that it assigns to the users who had all facilities, the actual single facilities, all of them.
And then we can go into user management and de-select them however we want.


@1:10:22 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Like, once that toggle is off, automatically, it also means that if they are trying to edit any single user or multiple users, basically drop-down will automatically appear.
Yes, yes, because it appears because I've got the single selections.


@1:10:39 - Yair Strano
I think that is the most easiest solution. That works. That works.


@1:10:47 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
It's a very rare occurrence, like putting in all that effort, yeah, to define.


@1:10:52 - Yair Strano
That's, yeah.


@1:10:54 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
It seems addition was good, if we can do it in the model level, but since the user is very...
... It's a very rare incident, and I don't think so it should be handled over there. It's just a lot of effort.


@1:11:07 - Yair Strano
Let's put it this way. Hasib's suggestion is more explicit and user-friendly. I think it's the better approach, but the effort required to do so for such a blue moon event is probably not necessary because what we can do is just say, you know what?
You deselect all the facilities, you still leave them with the single facility selections, which means that if you go edit them or bulk edit them, you can have the facility drop-down for those users.
Okay. Sure.


@1:11:44 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
We take a save selection and put it into that bulk edit, like having all the users and like making changes and modifications.
Right. When we get there, let's discuss that.


@1:11:57 - Yair Strano
Boom. Boom. You


@1:12:03 - adil khan
So we question actually, so if we assign a role and we toggle on that all active facility toggle, so we are going to delete all of the assigned facilities to that user?


@1:12:22 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
No, deleting it, like we will individually assign all the facilities to that user.


@1:12:30 - adil khan
Like, all of the facilities, which I have for existing users, like, suppose there's a role called, role called, role one, and role one has that toggle that all active facilities on.
So when we assign that role to a particular person, so we'll delete all the assigned facilities, which is previously assigned to that user, or we keep that facility as it is?


@1:12:57 - Yair Strano
I'm not following what you're saying, I don't Can you explain? I'm saying like, yeah, sure.


@1:13:03 - adil khan
let's just suppose, like me, I had two facilities assigned already. And we created a new role, which role has access to all the active facility.
So when I assign to that role, to me, it will delete all the previously assigned facilities to me or it will be in the background?


@1:13:25 - Yair Strano
We will delete all the previously assigned because now you're going to get all the other facilities. And then when you deselect the all facilities in the added role, you are left with all the singular facilities that you had.
No, not that you had, that you were given. So meaning if I'm a user and I was given two facilities and I have a role X, later I'm assigned role Y and role Y has all facilities tagged on.
My two facilities go away. I have all facilities tagged now, right? If all facilities... Later, Role Y gets edited, and all facilities goes away.
Me, the user, gets left with the singular cumulative list of all the facilities as of that time. And then they can go in.


@1:14:15 - adil khan
My point is, like, we can use previously assigned facilities as a fallback in case of we decided to remove all active facilities permissions.
The problem is, what if there were no previously assigned facilities?


@1:14:30 - Yair Strano
The other problem is, what if you bring a user on in 2022, and you remove the role in 2030?
You're going to go back eight years?


@1:14:42 - adil khan
Yeah, that's something that all the users should have, at least, a default facility available. So it can act as a fallback.


@1:14:49 - Yair Strano
Yeah, but what's wrong with the suggestion that the team is making? Meaning, in the event that you remove all facilities, you just simply assign all facilities at that time?
to that user. What's wrong with that?


@1:15:03 - adil khan
You have to go back and forth in order to change user permissions and re-correct all of the assigned facilities.
But if you already have a fallback, you don't have to worry about all of that scenarios.


@1:15:16 - Yair Strano
The problem with the fallback is that you're making a rule for hundreds of employees when only five or ten employees are going to be affected by what we're discussing.
Yeah, that's the case.


@1:15:30 - adil khan
Yeah. You know what I mean?


@1:15:33 - Yair Strano
I understand. It might not impact a lot of users.


@1:15:36 - adil khan
Yeah. But it just remove all of the other unnecessary or like other steps to re-correct the data. Because you already have a rule set in order to fall back.
Because what's problem you're gonna have, right?


@1:15:54 - Yair Strano
Like what if people don't have a default facility? Like, what do I give the executives? They don't have a default facility.


@1:16:02 - adil khan
But if they added in the system now, they should have a facility or if a new leadership member is onboarded in the future, then they have to just give them a default facility, like, or all facilities, even simply select all facilities, so it will fall back to that facility in case you remove the permissions.
So it's a, in my opinion, it's a much more similar, simple way, because you're just removing one single permission, and after removing all, just one single permission, you have to do a lot of work in order to correct the permissions and users and everything.


@1:16:47 - Yair Strano
Sorry, guys, give me one second, something urgent just popped up here. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry Bilal and Hamza and Mubashir, have we received an updated file from Atex?
Do you know?


@1:17:33 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Let me check with Muzamul. I'll just check the bucket quickly, I thought maybe you would know.


@1:17:39 - Yair Strano
January 29th, no, February 2nd, what is this Atex CSV? We have got a February 2nd file. Did Muzamul not see that?
I'll check that.


@1:17:55 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Can we please check Muzamul right away because there's a phone call going on Muzamul.


@1:18:00 - Yair Strano
With the Sheriff's Office now saying, with a bunch of back and forth. Sorry guys, just give me one second.
What a mess. Hey, hey, just hold your horses, so if they're saying that, just let me see if something was pushed to the bucket this morning, because I see that there's a little bit of traction at 8.20 this morning.
There was nothing up until 8.20 this morning, but I wasn't told by the team that anything came in, but I'm looking at the bucket and there is something.
Tell that, say, hey, if you've given us everything, we'll assess and let you know. Give me... She wants an update within two hours.
Give me a second. Let me see. Give me a second. Okay, there's no column header in this file, which is a problem.
So just tell her that, tell her we, I'll give you an update within two hours, okay? Okay, thank you so much.
Okay, bye, bye. Hey, we did get a data file. I'm surprised Muzamal didn't say anything. There's no header, and the issue with the quotes is still there.
Can we please ask Muzamal to prioritize a response as soon as possible? This is- It's something that we should be monitoring on an hourly basis.
It's already 11.24 in the morning. I don't know if maybe he's so busy with the code that he didn't look, but the problem is that I've got the sheriff's office now saying that they're waiting on us.
I told ATX this morning, no, we're waiting on them. But I'm looking here, there are no headers. There are no headers for some of the columns.
As a matter of fact, there are no headers, except for one. No, there are no headers at all. Hey, Muzzamil.
How are you doing, man?


@1:20:42 - Muhammad Muzzamil Raza
Hiya. I'm doing good.


@1:20:44 - Yair Strano
I got a call from the sheriff's office saying that we are the holdup on the data. And I was like, no, we're not.
We haven't received anything. But then I looked in the bucket. We got something this morning.


@1:20:55 - Muhammad Muzzamil Raza
Yes. But there are no headers.


@1:21:00 - Yair Strano
I no, I do see the spelling of the court correctives, but they haven't fixed the quotations wrapping, so they're still kicking out columns, and I don't know what other errors there are there.
Can you do me a favor? Can you please respond to this as soon as possible? On the same thread?
100%, because, I mean, how else are we going to get this resolved? All right. Yeah, because, and just to be clear, the sheriff's office, from now, we're under two weeks from launch, from now, we need to be monitoring the data feed very, very closely in order to hit our target.
So we can't afford to wait an entire day to get to them, because then I lose a day speaking with them, right?
So please, like, stay on, Michael, as often as you can, to make sure that we get what we need.
I'm going to call the, I'm going Call them now and say there's a problem with the file, and that an email will go out explaining what the problem is.
Just cross-check it. To me, it looks like there are no column headers. That's number one. And maybe you're okay with that.
Do you accept no column headers? No, actually, we need column headers.


@1:22:20 - Muhammad Muzzamil Raza
Oh, yeah, you said I need the names.


@1:22:22 - Yair Strano
So, hey, no column headers came through. You're still not wrapping in quotations. And if you see anything else that's not good for you, I also see they've been in everything.
Some stuff is in caps. Some stuff is in lowercase.


@1:22:41 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Let me see. Anyway, I'll leave it in your hands.


@1:22:45 - Yair Strano
If you can just get back to them and give them a comprehensive detail breakdown of what they need to do, I will follow up our phone and make sure it's done.
All right. Okay. Thank you so much, Muzzamo. All right.


@1:23:00 - Muhammad Muzzamil Raza
Thank you. Sorry, guys, let me just call and let him know.


@1:23:18 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Hey.


@1:23:20 - Yair Strano
Okay. Oh, hey, guys. I'm going to be really quick. I've got another meeting going on as I speak. Hi.
Hi.


@1:23:38 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Hi. Hi. Thank Okay. Okay. 115, maybe? you. The sound is muted here. Sorry guys, there's just a lot of pressure around this ATX launch.


@1:25:26 - Yair Strano
Did the team drop off?


@1:25:33 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Okay, sorry about that.


@1:25:35 - Yair Strano
There's been a tremendous amount of pressure like non-stop around this launch, so I just wanted to make sure that we pushed this through.
So, okay. Getting back to what Adil was saying, can you guys remind me where we're at? Sorry.


@1:26:03 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So yeah, like we were discussing the scenario of like if there was a role that was given the property of all archived facilities, all active facilities, and in future if that property is taken away from that role, so what would happen to all the users that were assigned that role.
So we basically landed upon that all those users would get assigned individually as a selection in the facility.org. All the facilities up to that time.
All the active facilities. Yes, all the active facilities. Yes, yes, I agree with that.


@1:26:38 - Yair Strano
And what I was pushing back on Adil about is I think that that is overkill that for hundreds and hundreds of employees you force a default facility when there are individuals, specifically the individuals who are getting this all facilities access, who don't have a default facility.
So I want to stick with saying. So give them all the facilities, it's a select handful of people, and then they can go in and edit whoever doesn't need something.


@1:27:10 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So yeah, like, just a reminder for everyone is that when we say recall facility is the facility that you have selected in the facility.com.
So you, as a super admin, must also have selected some facility. Like, if you go into inventory menu, you will see a facility name.
That is your default at this moment. But that's just, a default is almost like a lost viewed.


@1:27:39 - Yair Strano
Yes. It's not truly a default, and if anything, maybe our naming of that is wrong, to be honest. Like, that default nomenclature is one of the very first things we did when we launched the app, right?
Yes. So, and we don't... We call it default anywhere, correct?


@1:28:02 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes, we don't call it in the app. It's just how much pressure we have among that technique. Among ourselves, right?


@1:28:09 - Yair Strano
Yeah. Right. So, like, that to me is a lost viewed. But no one has a default facility. Like, we don't have that terminology in the app.
The facility, most individuals, 90-plus percent only have one facility. And that's the way it is. Like, as we grow, you work at one jail.
It's just the leadership that needs this access. So I think taking the blanket and pushing it out to those individuals at the singular level and then having the person who controls it go and edit it, I don't see any downside to that.
Thank you. Thank you. you. You Okay, so there are quite a few changes that like we need to write, but oh well no, no, not really, because once you do that, automatically you no longer have that tag and then the edit will appear for you, so you don't actually need to change the workflow.


@1:29:20 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes, it works within the rules that we have defined. Okay, perfect. So I've added these two scenarios that we just discussed into the ticket under the section of important note.
So one other important note is also that if two rules are selected for a user, and one of them has the all active facility property, then the rule that has the property trumps the other rule and they get interested in all facilities and facility program.
A hundred percent. Yes, that's right. We can now move on to us. Okay, so it's going to be this one, right?
So we will now discuss the same scenarios, but now for a role that has the property of all archive facilities.
So, scenario one, adding a user with a role that has all archive facilities property. When a user clicks on plus add user CPA and add user model should open, and when the user selects role with all archive facilities property, then the facility select drop-down should become optional.


@1:30:51 - Yair Strano
That's an interesting point. That means that there would be a use case that people could only have archive. I think we did this


@1:31:01 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yeah, we discussed it, like, there are going to be some users who will gonna have one of our card facility access.
So, I remember there was this role that you mentioned, Director of Audit. Exactly. That's That's exactly right. Yeah, actor facilities, or maybe in the future you meant, but like, initially they wouldn't be doing it.
That's absolutely right.


@1:31:25 - Yair Strano
Yep, that's right. It's good to have that flexibility, yeah. I'm with you.


@1:31:34 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
All right. So, similarly, when, like, when any user is being added to bulk upload, and if the user is being even adult with all actual facilities, then facility field should become an auction field.
ACTION ITEM: Implement login default for All Archive: switch to Archive; select newest terminated facility - WATCH
Similar situation would be for editing as well, when a user clicks on edit city in ellipses. Edit modal should open them, when the user selects a role with all artificial countries, then facilities like development should become optional.
So... So... I... to add an important note over here as well, if there is a user with a role with all archive facilities property and for them no active facility was assigned and when they log in, they have to log in, then archive facilities switched on and they will see the data on the single archive facility.
If there are multiple archive facilities, then assign them the most oldest facility that is archived, that is the one created first, as the view to which they log in.


@1:32:30 - Yair Strano
Yeah, that's fine. The only thing maybe I would change is don't say oldest, say newest. Because if they're auditing, I mean, if you already put in the effort in, I would say probably put the newest archive, right?
Because it's probably the one that they're going to audit. you're not that they And yes, all sorts of...


@1:33:00 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Fathom, what I mean by that is that a facility that was created first, like we will look at the date of creation of that facility, not when they got a Fathom.


@1:33:14 - Yair Strano
Oh, going by date of creation, is that easier for you than going by date of termination? It's the same.


@1:33:22 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
It's the same, so whatever is your preference.


@1:33:24 - Yair Strano
I would go, if it's the same, I would go with the termination date that is most recent. Okay. Yeah.
I'd go with termination date that's most recent. That makes more sense.


@1:33:38 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. let's Can we you? Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank come on, j.
Okay. here, them up. Okay. Okay, let's When's Thank And the second point is, if no active facilities were assigned to the user, that the user should not be able to switch off the archive facilities.
Switch. Yep, that makes sense. So over here, do we need to discuss those use cases as well that we discussed in the last ticket?
One of them is like discussed, like if we are switching off the, the other one was like, if they select a different role, and in that case, the facility drop down field would become mandatory, and they select a role for which this is, they don't have any drop down field.
So, let's say a user is having a role that has this toggle enabled, and if you disabled it, recorded it, then what are the ...
Facilities that are going to be linked with that user, all facilities, we will not allow them to make trouble at all, if no active facility is assigned to a user, so like in this case, this is also one of, like, a user that does not have any active facility assigned, but has been given access to other facilities, that is also a very small percentage of users.
Is that okay, Yair?


@1:35:32 - Yair Strano
So you're saying that if a user has no active facilities assigned to them, and you go into the role, and you want to deselect that toggle, right, of all archived facilities, you won't allow that action to proceed until they go assign an active facility to that user?
Yes, that's what we are proposing.


@1:35:57 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes, that's we are proposing. Yes, Yes,


@1:36:04 - Yair Strano
So the toast will be generic, right? You'll say there are users with this role that have no active facilities.
Please assign active facilities before making this change? Yes. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, let's just keep it as generic as possible because you could have a group, right?
You might go say that there's a role that you change in, and the role, let's just say it's like something ordered, and that role was given to 10 people.
9 people have another role that gives them access, right? Let's say to all facilities or to a facility, but one person only has the ordered role.
The one person is going to trigger the toast, even though they're 10 people, they're non-people who could be removed.
And that's okay. That's all I'm saying. Does that make sense? Like you want to keep it like very blanker, just say, because the way they can do it is select the role in the user base and then see what facilities they have.
For the ones who don't have a facility, they need to go give them one. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, that's perfect.


@1:37:25 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Okay, so I think we are done with this ticket, right? All right, moving on to our next ticket. So, users should be able to navigate and see both active and archived facilities in facilities menus.
And that would be very possible by having two tabs inside the facilities menu. First tab would be called active and the second tab would be called archive.
In the active tab should show all the active facilities in the application, there's a column that are already coming in the facilities menu right now.
An archive tab should show all the archived facilities in a table with the following columns, facility, address, population, non-state, and validation data.
So the question from the progress guide is what actions should be allowed for an archive facility? Actions in the ellipses in the action column.
We definitely want to edit, right?


@1:38:30 - Yair Strano
You want to be able to edit all those fields for sure. I don't think you want anything else because...


@1:38:41 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
An archive action? Do we need it? We actually decided that if in future we get a contract with Donate again, we will create a new IT.
That's right.


@1:38:56 - Yair Strano
And you would allow it to be the same name probably by the way. information by fine. you Whatever, we'll cross that bridge when we get there, right?
Like, I do think it could happen in a few years, 2028. We'll see what happens in 2028. But I think for now, I would just put edit, no delete, but unarchive is probably a useful action.
That's probably a useful action, honestly, knowing our people. Because let me ask you, let's start from the other side.
So the regular active, because right now our active shows termination dates. That means that we're going to move that, right?
So we're going to only show facility, facility units, address. And by the way, I would say while we're discussing this, let's move facility units over.
It should be facility, address, population, launch date, FCH. Whatever, we'll cross that bridge when we get there, right? Like, I do think it could happen in a few years, 2028.
We'll see what happens in 2028. But I think for now, I would just put edit, no delete, but unarchive is probably a useful action.
That's probably a useful action, honestly, knowing our people.


@1:40:31 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Because let me ask you, let's start from the other side. So the regular active, because right now our active shows termination dates.
That means that we're going to move that, right? So we're going to only show facility, facility units, address. And by the way, I would say while we're discussing this, let's move facility units over.
It should be facility, address, population, launch date, FCH.


@1:41:00 - Yair Strano
Facility Units, FCH Staff, right? Like, putting the units next to the facility name, it just seems it's in the wrong place.
That's just a side note. But we're going to do this. So we put it next to one? I think we should move it over to the between launch date and FCH Staff.


@1:41:24 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Because termination date goes away. That goes to the archive tab now, right?


@1:41:39 - Yair Strano
It's not that on the action of archive, we'll put in the termination date, it is defined by the users.
When you add the facility. So when we come to the action of archiving of facility, we will then discuss whether we should allow the termination date or not.
No, no, wait, guys. Hang on. You're saying that in the ad facility model, we already know when we're going to lose the contract?
Come on, no way. There is absolutely no way. If we added a facility, we should not be thinking like, , we're going to lose this contract in about two years.


@1:42:22 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
I think we should revamp that.


@1:42:26 - Yair Strano
We can take off this field from the ad model, and when you archive it, then we can have that field.


@1:42:31 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes, I would say, like, let's revamp that.


@1:42:34 - Yair Strano
I mean, I know why we did what we did. We did it quickly because we needed it for the claims management.
But, and this is a critical field for claims management, by the way. Termination date is like, you know, there are financial implications to it because it ends the term.
So, any bills afterwards, we have to kick back so we don't pay for them. But, I would remove this here.
Only have facility law. The termination date should be part of the action of archive, and I assume you're going to archive through the ellipsis, correct?
Yes, we will have the options of edit and archive. Okay, wonderful. So when you go archive, you open up a modal, And the modal is going to say what?
Just termination date? We can put some sort of copy that... We could do an AR, we could do an AR constellation, like don't, don't beat yourself up.
You're okay. Tenty efficiency, whatever other quotes of the day you want to give them. But it's a pretty action.
Let me tell you something. Like when we have to archive a facility, it's bad news. But if you click archive, then...
Hmm. Host. Uh… Then you would have, basically, yeah, we could do a game over, like, you know, those old 80s games, like, game over, like, dropping down, like, with the pixels, that, like, game over.
We should do something like that, honestly. And then, and then have a termination date. Like, I don't know, it's probably a lot of you are probably too young to even remember.
Do you remember Prince of Persia?


@1:44:30 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Was like, yeah. So, if you did, like, that style.


@1:44:35 - Yair Strano
You know what I mean? Like, old, old school. So, anyway, we have that. And then you could have, like, a termination date that then sets the facility from active to archived.
And then in archived, you show the columns that you have. And then in archived, in the actions, you could have unarchived.
Are you sure?


@1:44:59 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes. Then you could do a congratulations! And then just to mess with that, here's the thing, the only people doing this are like the internal staff, like who would laugh.
So we actually could do something funnier. But that would push it back to active. And then the edits would only be the fields that you're showing for those columns.
That's the only change I would make to what you have. I think if we have downtime, like for real, if we have downtime and we're bored, we should work on some 80s graphics for like the archive and the un-archive, like for real, for real.
Make it look as basic as possible.


@1:45:57 - Yair Strano
So like... like... If we move to the next ticket, in that ticket, I have defined the action of archiving a facility.


@1:46:06 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So over there now I will define that upon selecting this action, we would have a confirmation model, and if the user selects yes, then we populate the termination date column in the archiving that.


@1:46:24 - Yair Strano
Right? One second. Are you sure you want to walk on the surface? It's actually going to be undone. I'm yes and no CTAs, yes should be undone.
One second. second. One second. Say that again, Hamza, the what? So like initially, like, I did not have the archived action, hence I wrote this copy of this action cannot be undone.
I'm not going to take it away from the copy. Yeah, you could take that away. Do you still want to move?
And Hamza can decide whether the CTA should


@1:47:02 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Yes. And within the model, we will have that field of termination date. Yeah, you have termination date. Automatically, we populate the date.
No, no, no, no, no. Put the field, Hamza, because they may forget to do it. Yeah, yeah. Please put the field.
You could put the default to be today. Meaning default the day they do it, but please make it editable.
Knowing the team, they're not going to do it on time. I'll guarantee you.


@1:47:58 - Yair Strano
And this question, Sure, can we go away. Right, so I'll recommend that design well beside the color of CTA and what all.
Alright, so we can now move to unexpected. This is actually a big one and we have like eight minutes left.
So we'll start the discussion, but like probably we would need to... I you know what, I'm saying, does it make sense to pause if it's a big one and just attack it more with a fresh mind?
Yeah, takes to, yeah. It is a big one. Let's pause to pick up on that one. Now I And attack it with a fresh mind.
I think that's better. And what I can do is I can give you guys, first of all, before we move on, thank you to Product for putting this together.
This is dusting off the cobwebs from a very, very long time ago. I'll be, I will admit, it took me a while to get my head back into the mode of this.
I got very confused in the beginning. So, job, and thank you to everyone who participated and gave very valuable feedback.
I thought there was a part there that was quite difficult to get through, but we landed where we needed to.
And, Adil, I appreciate you challenging and standing your ground. And, even if, you know, we end up making, not the best technical decision for the developers, but the better decision for the business.
I know it's a little bit more difficult where we landed, but. I appreciate the open-mindedness from everyone. So just high level, you know, so far it seems like no call-outs are gone in safe.
The emails look wonderful. I've been getting them. So much easier to read them. So easy to follow now what's actually going on between the report being submitted, the review being done.
Like, it's a huge one, guys. I think that that was a very, very good release. We haven't had any complaints, no call-outs.
So I think really good stuff to all the team. Like, congrats. And pre-intake, don't get too comfortable yet because no one's using it.
But, um, so I just wanted to let you know, it is released, it's released, and it's... Production, but no one's using it.
Probably because leadership is scared to make this transition. So they are going to take their time to make sure that they understand it really well, that they prep everyone, that they give out a whole training, and then they'll make the shift saying, okay, the Cognito forms are done.
We're now using the app. I don't know yet when it's going to be, but if I get an update on that, I'll let you know.
So for now, just know that there's a big feature that's not currently being used, and when it does go into effect, that's going to be the official shift of us going into the paradigm of we're on and we never go down, right?
Because intake at the jails is 24-7. So that's an update on the app, and that there are a few other features that are going to be coming down our way.
Thank you. Thank you. you. Clinical, that seem to be of need. So the business, as we're kind of dealing with the issues that are on the ground, more app features are presenting themselves.
So there'll be more to come on that just for everyone to know.


@1:52:16 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Tech Ops is aware and we're still trying to figure out what they are and what priority they're going to take.


@1:52:24 - Yair Strano
The only other thing I was going to say is that as far as ATEX goes, just to relay the message, there's now what's happening here is that like the pressure is starting to be felt by the county and they're pointing fingers at us.
We want to be trained this week. We're like, we can't train you. We don't have the data. They're like, oh, we gave you the data.
No, you didn't give us the data. Like, right, there's all this. It's very bureaucratic. So. Please reiterate, and I shouldn't be more explicit about this, like, as you come in, let's see where we are on the data, because that's the one thing that's holding us back right now.
We're in control of everything else, right? I think Friday we hit our target, is everything done? Yes, so now this testing is going on, testing is going on, on the feature, so.
Fantastic. product, yeah, product will also start testing on the consumer flow from tomorrow. Okay, wonderful. So, yeah, so, like, let's just, I'd say, again, tell Muzzamil that if I wasn't, I wasn't explicit enough, and I'm sorry to, like, bring him in so quickly, I mean, like, hey, we've got to do this, but there's, like, daily, you know, pushback from them saying, we've done our part, now you guys need to give us training.


@1:53:53 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
We're saying, well, we don't have the data. So, until we get the data, until we see the frequency set at...


@1:54:00 - Yair Strano
15 minutes. I can't say, I can't commit to any training. Between you and me, the goal is still to train them next week, but this is such a critical week.
It's already Monday, tomorrow's Tuesday, like we need the data in the right format and at the right frequency. So just please relay that message and I'll handle everything else, meaning like with the sheriff's office and I'm also dealing with HMS.
They pushed back requesting a few things from us, so I'm dealing with that as well. But I think that as of now, we are in a good position.
And that's it. That's the update I've got. Tomorrow, Tech Ops, are we on?


@1:54:53 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Do we have the clarity on the control substances? Oh, no, no, that was an amazing... It was in session we had with product last week that we, Hamza and Bilal prepped the full feedback.
I have full clarity. Friday was an executive leadership out-in for the team, for all the leaders.


@1:55:15 - Yair Strano
So Josh was there, Bernard was there. I unfortunately was on the meeting the entire day with the lawyers about the lawsuit.
So I could not attend, but long story short, we obviously didn't have tech ops. So, meaning internal tech ops.
ACTION ITEM: Cancel Feb 3 team meeting; cancel Tech Ops Feb 3 - WATCH
So I haven't had a chance. It'll be this Friday. So from my perspective, you guys can take the time.


@1:55:40 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
you want to focus on anything ATEX or whatever it is that you want to catch up on, please take it.
We can cancel tomorrow if you want. Yeah, I was also thinking that from tomorrow, like heavy focus should be on like product testing of the ATEX.


@1:55:56 - Yair Strano
So I think we can stick tomorrow.


@1:56:00 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
And like Hamza and Bilal side can focus on and also me like on the ATX side like testing the stuff like we are considering that like we have just this week, four days left with the launch.


@1:56:13 - Yair Strano
Okay, so then let's do that. Wednesday will be off, Thursday we will have an ATX touch base.


@1:56:21 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
What I'll say is that if there's a need for us to hop on tomorrow for ATX for whatever reason, we'll do so.
Otherwise, you focus on what you guys have to do. Friday, we'll have a design meeting with Hamza, imagine, yeah?
All right.


@1:56:38 - Yair Strano
Makes sense, yeah. If Hamza Jamal has anything ready. All right. So yeah, there's nothing on the plate of Hamza Jamal right now.
Like there's small items, I guess, of ATX. Like there's back and forth between Keyware, all right. just we need.
So then Kaz and Puade, if there's no need, then let the team focus. can


@1:57:00 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So Friday as well, but we have finalized four tickets, he can prepare for those designs, the related to archive, oh yeah, I mean, if he has bandwidth for sure, if he'll be ready to review, we could do a Friday, otherwise he can get started for sure.
Yeah. Yeah. On Friday there is, I think, some of the holidays.


@1:57:26 - Yair Strano
Oh, so yeah, Thursday is a holiday here, so... Oh, it is? Yes. Thursday, yeah, and... Oh, okay. Okay, so if Thursday is a holiday, then let's, so then why don't we meet...
, guys, do you guys want to just do a, you want to do an ATX touch base tomorrow? No, I mean...
There's nothing to update, right? There is nothing to update. It can be done on Friday. Okay. But I think maybe me, Muzzamil, and you can join like on Thursday.
will talk to Muzzamil.


@1:58:18 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
Like maybe for just updates we can talk on Thursday. Only if there's only if there are updates, we can have a quick meeting.


@1:58:30 - Yair Strano
Otherwise, I don't want to have a meeting just for the sake of a meeting. You know what I mean?
Like same thing with Friday. Like I'd rather the team focus and end the week calmly and have like the last two hours of the week be a meeting for no reason.


@1:58:45 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
So if designs are not ready by Friday, we don't need to meet on design. I think TechOps we cancel in regardless.
We're going to focus on this launch.


@1:58:54 - Yair Strano
As far as ATEX updates go, if there's something to update on, we can. If there's nothing, we can wait till Friday.
All right. Look, I'm going to be keeping you posted in real time. One thing that Muzamil should please do me a favor is just stay on the email about the data every single day.
If possible. We discussed that in daily meetings, but we did a mistake that we were just expecting an email from them.
I know, me too, Matt. Me too. I made the same mistake. Like, I take ownership of that. I even said to them this morning, no, nothing's in.
Like, go ahead, push back. And then when they called me while I was on the meeting with you, they were like, they're saying that they sent you something.


@1:59:40 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
That's when I was like, well, what's going on? Like, why are we not? I made the same mistake. Yeah, for me and Muzamil, like, we'll be continuously watching on the bucket and also, like, communicating with them.


@1:59:52 - Yair Strano
Yeah, we just got to keep pushing back, back, back until we get it. And hopefully we can get this done by Thursday.
Because I would love love to. to know that by Friday we are good, so I think what we should do is this, cancel the meeting tomorrow, Wednesday there's no meeting, Thursday you guys are off, I do think we need an ATEX meeting on Friday, with the goal of using Sandbox for the data to train on, Let me ask you really quickly, are we going to feed the data feed into Sandbox, or is that a separate database?
ACTION ITEM: Feed 1 ATEX data feed into Sandbox by Feb 9; notify Yair - WATCH
No, we can, it will be separate databases for production and Sandbox, yeah.


@2:00:46 - bilal khalid (CarbonTeq)
But we can feed that later. Yeah, we can feed that. Okay, because what I'm going to ask you to do is feed one of the data feeds into the Sandbox environment so we can test them, okay.


@2:00:58 - Yair Strano
Yeah, that will be done, yeah.


@2:00:59 - adil khan
Yeah, that It will be ready till Monday, no worries. Okay, perfect, because we're going to test. Our goal is to start testing Monday, if we can.
Just do me one favor and follow through on the data. Yeah, sure. Wonderful. Wonderful, guys. All right, let me let you go.
It's 12.05. I know it's already late by you. And this is a good way to kick off the week strong.
And yeah, that's all. That's all I've got. All right. All right. Okay, thanks so much. Have a good night, and we'll speak later this week.
All right. All right. Ciao, everyone. Ciao. Bye-bye.-bye.
